**errata-diff.yml** â€” An individual katprep host maintenance report
variable file

DESCRIPTION
===========

A *errata-diff.yml* file is an individual katprep host maintenance
report variable file used by **katprep\_report(1)** in order to create
host reports. The following information can be found in the variable
file:

-  Generic system information (hostname, IP address,...)
-  Verification data obtained by **katprep\_maintenance(1)**
-  Errata delta information (CVEs, packages,...) between two
   infrastructure snapshot reports created by **katprep\_snapshot(1)**

Usually, these variable files are removed automatically - but for
debugging purposes or writing your own templates it might be necessary
to check the content. To preserve YAML files execute
**katprep\_report(1)** like this:

$ katprep\_report errata\*json -t *template* -x

A valid variable file is written in YAML and contains the following
dictionaries:

-  errata
-  params
-  verification
